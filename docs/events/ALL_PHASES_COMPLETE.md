## Known Limitations

1. **Database Testing:** Permission issue prevents local test execution. Tests are structurally sound.
2. **Real-time Chat:** No WebSocket - users must reload to see new messages.
3. **Chat History:** Only 20 messages retained per event.
4. **No Edit/Delete:** Events cannot be edited or deleted (future enhancement).

---

## Future Enhancements

### High Priority
- WebSocket for real-time chat
- Edit event (host only)
- Delete event (soft delete)
- Remove members (host only)

### Medium Priority
- Event images/photos
- Export event details
- Email notifications
- Calendar integration (.ics)

### Low Priority
- Event categories/tags
- Recurring events
- Event search by date range
- Event recommendations
- Social sharing

---
